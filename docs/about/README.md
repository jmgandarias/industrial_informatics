## Welcome

This is the home of the Industrial Informatics course: A fourth-year undergraduate course for Electronics Engineering students in [the School of Industrial Engineering](https://www.uma.es/escuela-de-ingenierias-industriales/) at [the University of Málaga](https://www.uma.es). 
The content of this website is being developed by [Prof. Juan M. Gandarias](https://jmgandarias.com), an Assistant Professor in the [Systems Engineering and Automation Department](https://www.uma.es/isa). The course of Industrial Informatics and its content at the University is given by [Prof. Carlos Pérez-de-Pulgar](https://www.uma.es/isa/info/76432/cperez/) and [Prof. Juan M. Gandarias](https://jmgandarias.com).

## Course content

- [Intro to the course](../intro/README.md)
- [Microcontrollers programming](../microcontrollers_programming/README.md)
- [Real-Time Control Systems](../real-time_control_systems/README.md)
- [Real-Time in Embedded Systems](../real-time_embedded_systems/README.md)
- [Human-Machine Interfaces](../hmi/README.md)
- [Internet of Things with MQTT](../mqtt/README.md)

<!-- The course here is designed to teach students how to use **ROS (the Robot Operating System)** to program robots, using a mix of simulation-based learning and real robot hardware. Most of the initial learning is done in simulation, and we've got [a WSL-based simulation environment that we use for this](../software/wsl-ros/README.md). Everything that is taught in simulation is applicable to real robots too, and - through this course - students are able to apply their new-found ROS knowledge to our [real TurtleBot3 Waffle Robots](./robots.md) in The Diamond. -->

## Other Courses

This site is now also used to support the teaching of labs for an [AMRC Training Centre](https://amrctraining.co.uk/) module (**AMR31001**), and the course has also been adapted for a masters-level module for the department of [Automatic Control and Systems Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse) (**ACS6121**). See [Other Courses](../others/amr31001/README.md) for more details. -->
