# Getting Started

## 1. What is a Microcontroller?

A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to perform specific tasks within an embedded system. Unlike general-purpose computers, microcontrollers are optimized for controlling devices, sensors, and actuators in real-time applications.
Key characteristics:

- Low power consumption
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Integration of CPU, memory, and peripherals on a single chip

Microcontrollers are widely used in automation, robotics, IoT devices, and industrial control systems.

## 2. Course Hardware and Tools

In this course, we will use the following components and tools:

### 2.1. ESP32 Microcontroller

The [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) is a powerful and versatile microcontroller featuring:

- Dual-core processor
- Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- Multiple GPIO pins for sensors and actuators
- Support for various communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART)

### 2.2. Wokwi Simulator

[Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) is an online simulator that allows you to:

- Prototype circuits without physical hardware
- Test and debug Arduino, ESP32, and other microcontrollers projects
- Visualize sensor and actuator behavior in simulated real-time
  
### 2.3. Arduino IDE

The [Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide/#ide-v2) will be our main programming tool. It provides:

- A simple interface for writing and uploading code
- Extensive libraries for sensors, displays, and communication
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### 2.4. M5Core2 Development Kit

The [M5Core2](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/core2) is an ESP32-based device with:

- A touchscreen display
- Built-in sensors and expansion ports
- A modular design for rapid prototyping
